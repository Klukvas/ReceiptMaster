# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the MarketFlow project.

## Workflows

### 1. `test.yml` - Testing and Validation
- **Triggers:** Pull requests to main, pushes to main
- **Purpose:** Run tests, linting, and build validation
- **Jobs:**
  - `test-backend`: Run backend tests, linting, and build
  - `test-frontend`: Run frontend linting and build
  - `docker-build-test`: Build Docker images for testing (not pushed)

### 2. `build-and-deploy.yml` - Docker Build and Deploy
- **Triggers:** Pull requests to main, pushes to main
- **Purpose:** Build and push Docker images to GitHub Container Registry
- **Registry:** `ghcr.io`
- **Behavior:**
  - **On PR:** Builds and pushes images with commit SHA tag
  - **On main push:** Builds and pushes images with both SHA and `latest` tags
- **Images:**
  - `ghcr.io/{owner}/{repo}/frontend:{sha}` (always)
  - `ghcr.io/{owner}/{repo}/backend:{sha}` (always)
  - `ghcr.io/{owner}/{repo}/frontend:latest` (main branch only)
  - `ghcr.io/{owner}/{repo}/backend:latest` (main branch only)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Container Registry
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Actions" â†’ "General"
3. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
4. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### 2. Repository Secrets (if needed)
The workflows use `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. No additional secrets are required for basic functionality.

### 3. Package Visibility
1. Go to your repository's "Packages" section
2. Set package visibility to "Public" or "Private" as needed
3. Configure access permissions for your team

## Usage

### For Pull Requests
- All tests and builds run automatically
- Docker images are built and pushed for testing
- No production deployment occurs

### For Main Branch Pushes
- All tests and builds run
- Docker images are built and pushed with commit SHA
- Production images with `latest` tag are deployed

### Manual Workflow Triggers
You can manually trigger workflows from the GitHub Actions tab:
1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Image Tags

- `latest`: Production images (main branch only)
- `{sha}`: Specific commit images
- `{branch}`: Branch-specific images
- `pr-{number}`: Pull request images

## Monitoring

- Check the "Actions" tab for workflow status
- View build logs for debugging
- Monitor package registry for image updates
- Set up notifications for failed builds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure workflow permissions are set correctly
   - Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has necessary permissions

2. **Docker Build Fails**
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Review build context and file paths

3. **Registry Push Fails**
   - Verify registry credentials
   - Check package visibility settings
   - Ensure repository has package write permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test Docker builds locally
docker build -t marketflow-frontend:test ./frontend
docker build -t marketflow-backend:test ./backend

# Test image functionality
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 marketflow-backend:test
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 marketflow-frontend:test
```
